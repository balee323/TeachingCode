***Homework Assignment 2:

1. Create a console program  (choose .net framework)

2. Create some code in the Main Method() that:
	a. Shows a console message "sup from while loop" 5 times (using a while loop).   //regular while loop
	b. Shows a console message "sup from for loop" 2 times (using for loop)       //for loop  (different than foreach)
	c. Show a console message "sup once from do-while loop"                       //do while loop...
		1. Use a bool variable called runOnce.  Set this to true initially.
		2. set runOnce = false inside the do-while loop"
		3. Play around with what happens when you change the initial value of runOnce (toggle between true and false)

3. Commit and push to GitHub remote repo.
