***Homework Arrays part 1:

1. Create a console program  (choose .net framework)

2. The program will print a list of numbers to the console and show which element position has the number 36.

	put these numbers into an int array:
	1, 3, 47, 22, 9, 36, 8, -5


3. The Program will show the count of all elements in the array to the console by using a loop (don't use Length property).

4. Now that you know the length of the array, print the elements to the console in reverse order
-Use the length of the array -1, as the first item and iterate backwards.
	
5. All code must be put into a function(s) and iterate the array using For loop, while loop, or For each loop.



6. Commit and push to GitHub remote repo.
