Assignment:  Create a console application:

Visual studio -> new project

C#
Windows
Console

-> .Net Framework (not core)



Name the solution "homeworks"

and the inital project "HW1"

*The wizard will try to match the solution with the project name, so
name the solution first.


Open the program.cs file.

This file will have the main method, which is the entry point into
the console application.


Code:

Add "hello world" console line.  

Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

be sure to add Console.ReadKey();  at the end
so the program doesn't just zip throw at 30000000 Miles per hour.



Once you got that working...  Add some boolean stuff.

Create a boolean variable and name it canContinue.  Set it to false initally.

create an if statement that looks that the value of "canContinue".  
Run another Console.WriteLine("something..."); inside the if statement 

if(some bool){
//some code
}


Happy coding.  Feel the itch!
